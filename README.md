# Basic.css
Welcome. basic.css. This is a small project which I started and what it is supposed to be, as the name probably suggests, is a small and easy to use CSS framework.

Basic, while being AMAZING on its own, works best if edited, imporved and customized for your site. If you need some help, just message me on GitHub.
